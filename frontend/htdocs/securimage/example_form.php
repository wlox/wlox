 * Project:     Securimage: A PHP class for creating and managing form CAPTCHA images<br />
 * File:        form.php<br /><br />
 *
 * This is a very simple form sending a username and password.<br />
 * It demonstrates how you can integrate the image script into your code.<br />
 * By creating a new instance of the class and passing the user entered code as the only parameter, you can then immediately call $obj->checkCode() which will return true if the code is correct, or false otherwise.<br />
