Proper handling of data uris as attachments. Attachment `path` property can also be defined as a data uri, not just regular url or file path.

Bumped libmime and mailbuild versions to properly handle filenames with spaces (short ascii only filenames with spaces were left unquoted).

Return deprecatin error for v0.x style configuration

## v1.1.1 2014-07-30

Bumped nodemailer-direct-transport dependency. Updated version includes a bugfix for Stream nodes handling. Important only if use direct-transport with Streams (not file paths or urls) as attachment content.

## v1.1.0 2014-07-29

Added new method `resolveContent()` to get the html/text/attachment content as a String or Buffer.

## v1.0.4 2014-07-23

Bugfix release. HTML node was instered twice if the message consisted of a HTML
content (but no text content) + at least one attachment with CID + at least
one attachment without CID. In this case the HTML node was inserted both to
the root level multipart/mixed section and to the multipart/related sub section

## v1.0.3 2014-07-16

Fixed a bug where Nodemailer crashed if the message content type was multipart/related

## v1.0.2 2014-07-16

Upgraded nodemailer-smtp-transport to 0.1.11. The docs state that for SSL you should use 'secure' option but the underlying smtp-connection module used 'secureConnection' for this purpose. Fixed smpt-connection to match the docs.

## v1.0.1 2014-07-15

Implemented missing #close method that is passed to the underlying transport object. Required by the smtp pool.
