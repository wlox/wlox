# smtp-connection

SMTP client module. Connect to SMTP servers and send mail with it.

This module is the successor for the client part of the (now deprecated) SMTP module [simplesmtp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplesmtp). For matching SMTP server see [smtp-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smtp-server).

## Usage

Install with npm

    npm install smtp-connection

Require in your script

    var SMTPConnection = require('smtp-connection');

### Create SMTPConnection instance

```javascript
var connection = new SMTPConnection(options);
```

Where

  * **options** defines connection data
    * **options.port** is the port to connect to (defaults to 25 or 465)
    * **options.host** is the hostname or IP address to connect to (defaults to 'localhost')
    * **options.secure** defines if the connection should use SSL (if `true`) or not (if `false`)
    * **options.ignoreTLS** turns off STARTTLS support if true
    * **options.requireTLS** forces the client to use STARTTLS. Returns an error if upgrading the connection is not possible or fails.
    * **options.name** optional hostname of the client, used for identifying to the server
    * **options.localAddress** is the local interface to bind to for network connections
    * **options.connectionTimeout** how many milliseconds to wait for the connection to establish
    * **options.greetingTimeout** how many milliseconds to wait for the greeting after connection is established
    * **options.socketTimeout** how many milliseconds of inactivity to allow
    * **options.debug** if true, the connection emits all traffic between client and server as 'log' events
    * **options.authMethod** defines preferred authentication method, e.g. 'PLAIN'
    * **options.tls** defines additional options to be passed to the socket constructor, e.g. *{rejectUnauthorized: true}*
    * **options.socket** - existing socket to use instead of creating a new one

### Events

SMTPConnection instances are event emitters with the following events

  * **'error'** *(err)* emitted when an error occurs. Connection is closed automatically in this case.
  * **'connect'** emitted when the connection is established
  * **'end'** when the instance is destroyed
  * **'log'** *(data)* emitted for all traffic when debug option is set to true

### connect

Establish the connection

```javascript
connection.connect(callback)
```

Where

  * **callback** is the function to run once the connection is established. The function is added as a listener to the 'connect' event.

After the connect event the `connection` has the following properties:

  * **connection.secure** - if `true` then the connection uses a TLS socket, otherwise it is using a cleartext socket. Connection can start out as cleartext but if available (or `requireTLS` is set to true) connection upgrade is tried

### login

If the server requires authentication you can login with

```javascript
connection.login(auth, callback)
```

Where

  * **auth** is the authentication object
    * **auth.user** is the username
    * **auth.pass** is the password for the user
    * **auth.xoauth2** is the OAuth2 access token (preferred if both `pass` and `xoauth2` values are set) or an [XOAuth2](https://github.com/andris9/xoauth2) token generator object.
  * **callback** is the callback to run once the authentication is finished. Callback has the following arguments
    * **err** and error object if authentication failed

If a [XOAuth2](https://github.com/andris9/xoauth2) token generator is used as the value for `auth.xoauth2` then you do not need to set `auth.user`. XOAuth2 generator generates required accessToken itself if it is missing or expired. In this case if the authentication fails, a new token is requeested and the authentication is retried. If it still fails, an error is returned.

**XOAuth2 Example**

```javascript
var generator = require('xoauth2').createXOAuth2Generator({
    user: '{username}',
    clientId: '{Client ID}',
    clientSecret: '{Client Secret}',
    refreshToken: '{refresh-token}'
});

// listen for token updates
// you probably want to store these to a db
generator.on('token', function(token){
    console.log('New token for %s: %s', token.user, token.accessToken);
});

// login
connection.login({
    xoauth2: generator
}, callback);
```

### send

Once the connection is authenticated (or just after connection is established if authentication is not required), you can send mail with

```javascript
connection.send(envelope, message, callback)
```

Where

  * **envelope** is the envelope object to use
    * **envelope.from** is the sender address
    * **envelope.to** is the recipient address or an array of addresses
  * **message** is either a String, Buffer or a Stream. All newlines are converted to \r\n and all dots are escaped automatically, no need to convert anything before.
  * **callback** is the callback to run once the sending is finished or failed. Callback has the following arguments
    * **err** and error object if sending failed
      * **code** string code identifying the error, for example 'EAUTH' is returned when authentication fails
      * **response** is the last response received from the server (if the error is caused by an error response from the server)
      * **responseCode** is the numeric response code of the `response` string (if available)
    * **info** information object about accepted and rejected recipients
      * **accepted** and array of accepted recipient addresses
      * **rejected** and array of rejected recipient addresses
      * **response** is the last response received from the server

### quit

Use it for graceful disconnect

```javascript
connection.quit();
```

### close

Use it for less graceful disconnect

```javascript
connection.close();
```
